Implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm


The attach files @Encrypt.cpp and Decrypt.cpp perform the encryption and decryption process acording to a public key and a local key that enter as parameter

Considering that the prime numbers $p$ and $q$ that are usually taken are sought to be as large as possible (the algorithm bases its security on computational complexity) an implementation was made using large numbers in c ++. In this case considering that any variable allows to store numbers greater than $10^{100}$
